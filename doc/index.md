> HTML5-like responsive background images in CSS (sort of …)

## About

The purpose of *responsive-images-css* is to ease the creation process of responsive background images in CSS. It provides similar semantics as responsive images via `<img srcset="…" sizes="…">` in HTML5.

The rendering sequence of a standard HTML5 responsive (foreground) image is a highly complex process. It's impossible to fully predict which exact image candidate a browser will pick as some decisions may depend on environment settings that are only available at runtime (such as the network performance).

In contrast, *responsive-images-css* generates CSS code on the server-side — that is, long before the browser gets to interpret the generated output. To make this work, some asumptions have to be made:

* The generator needs a fixed **em to pixel ratio** in order to predictably deal with `em` / `rem` values.
* The generator utilizes the given breakpoints only, even if the image candidates suggest additional steps.
* The device densities (resolutions) for which the CSS should be rendered must be explictly provided.

## Usage

The main entry point for the creation of a responsive background image is the **Generator**. You will want to use it like this:

1. Create a **Generator** instance and let it know the **CSS breakpoints** (ignored for resolution based rulesets) and the `em`-to-`px` ratio for your project.
2. Register a set of **Image Candidates**, each candidate coming with either a **width** or **resolution descriptor** (corresponds to `srcset` in HTML5).
3. Trigger the creation of a CSS ruleset by passing in a **list of resolutions** to render the ruleset for. Optionally a **`sizes` specification** can be provided to further specify the image candidate relevance (width based image candidates only).

### Resolution based responsive image

### Width based responsive image

### Width based responsive image with `sizes` specification




## Installation

This library requires PHP 7.1 or later. I recommend using the latest available version of PHP as a matter of principle. It has no userland dependencies.

## Dependencies

## Quality

To run the unit tests at the command line, issue `composer install` and then `phpunit` at the package root. This requires [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to be available as `composer`, and [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/manual/) to be available as `phpunit`.

This library attempts to comply with [PSR-1][], [PSR-2][], and [PSR-4][]. If you notice compliance oversights, please send a patch via pull request.
